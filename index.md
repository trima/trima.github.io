## Moncef Trima

Software engineer.

My interests include Concurrency and using Computer Science to solve real-world problems. Recently, my interest has shifted towards more applicative areas of Software Engineering. Long walks, hiking and going on trips by train are a few examples of the activities I enjoyâ€¦although, to my disappointment, there are no railway services worthy of that name [where I live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annaba){:target="_blank"}.
