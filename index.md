## Moncef Trima
Software engineer from [Annaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annaba){:target="_blank"}. Currently looking for a job position.

I am mostly interested in concurrency and in applying Computer Science to solve real world problems. I like long walks, hiking and going on trips by train…although, thanks to covid, I didn’t get the chance to occupy myself with the last two and, to my disappointment, there are no railway services worthy of that name where I live.

Deep and long conversations are one of my favorite kinds of interactions. I like to talk about anything really (hum…more like what interests me :), but I most certainly enjoy being alone with my thoughts.
